          The objective of the game is to correctly identify the colours and positions of a number
          of coloured balls. The hidden solution will follow the parameters set via the settings tab. The settings tab
          is
          disabled in the challenge mode, the rules of the challenge are detailed below.
        </p>
        <p class="main-rules">
          The player selects a sequence of coloured balls and uses the resulting peg indicators to work
          their way toward the solution. A correct colour in the wrong place results in a white peg. A correct colour in
          the correct place results in a black peg.
        </p>

          A correct guess will result in all black pegs

        <img src="assets/images/rules/active-row.png" alt="the active row has a light blue border around the number">
        <p>
          A blue border indicates the currently active row, shown here around row 1. Each row consists of:
          <ul class="text-left-list ends-rule">
            <li>A number: to indicate the score if you correctly guess on this row</li>
            <li>A row of balls: equal to the number of balls selected via the settings tab</li>
            <li>A set of pegs: equal to the number of balls</li>

        <img src="assets/images/rules/ball-selected.png" alt="first ball selected with a border" class="below-list">
        <p>
          To select a colour, first tap (or click) the ball you wish to change. This will give the selected ball a
          border

        <img src="assets/images/rules/selector-balls-no-clear.png" alt="colour selection panel">
        <p>
          The colour selection panel will appear. It will contain colours equal to the number
          of colours selected in the settings tab. Simply tap (or click) the colour you wish the selected ball to be
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/rules/selector-balls-with-clear.png" alt="colour selection panel with clear option">
        <p>
          If you make a mistake, simply re-select the ball you wish to change. The colour selection panel will now
          have a <span class="small-caps">'Clear'</span> option. You may clear the colour, or select the new colour you
          wish to use

          icon to confirm your guess and see the result

        <img src="assets/images/rules/result-one-b-one-w.png"
          alt="completed row with one black result peg and one white result peg">
        <p>Once you have confirmed your guess, the result pegs will be displayed in that row:
          <ul class="text-left-list">
            <li>A black peg indicates you have a colour correct and in the <span class="bold">correct</span> position
            </li>
            <li>A white peg indicates you have a colour correct but it is in the <span class="bold">wrong</span>
              position
            </li>
            <li>No peg indicates an incorrect colour</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Peg positions do not relate to ball positions. Tthe example shown means 1 of the 4 colours is correctly
            positioned, and 1 of the 4 colours is incorrectly positioned. 2 of the colours are incorrect
          </p>

        <p>
          Don't worry if you get to the last row on the board. A new row will be created to allow you to continue. There
          is a limit, but you would have to be going for quite a while to reach it

          If you are struggling, tap (or click) the question mark <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> icon. A prompt
          will ask if you are sure you wish to reveal a colour. If you select 'OK', the hidden colour furthest to the
          right will be revealed. If you have opted for a hint and change your mind, simply select 'Cancel'.
          <span class="bold">You may not reveal the final colour this way</span> but you may reveal more than one, one
          at
          a time

          alt="the skull and bones icon is to the left of the solution row">
        <p>If you really don't want to continue, or you just want to know the answer, tap (or click) the skull and bones
          <i class="fas fa-skull-crossbones"></i> icon. A prompt will appear allowing you to confirm your choice to give
          up. If you are certain, select 'OK' and the game will end. The solution will be revealed and you will be given
          the option to play again. If you decline that option, the game board will remain so you can review the game.
          If
          you change your mind about giving up, simply select 'Cancel' on the first prompt</p>

        <p>
          If you are successful in guessing the correct solution, <span class="bold">you win!</span> A prompt will
          appear
          with the details of your game and you will have an option to play again. To do so, select 'OK'. If you wish to
          bask in your glory, select 'Cancel' and the guesses and solution will remain for you to view

        <p>
          If you were clever (or lucky!) enough to beat your previous best score or best time without having changed any
          settings, the values will be updated and displayed. They are independent of each other. If you guess in fewer
          guesses but take a longer time, the score will update and the time will remain the same and vice versa
